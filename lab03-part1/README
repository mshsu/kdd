# SUBMISSION DESCRIPTION
Python Scripts

# INSTRUCTIONS
Must have the following packages:
- pandas, numpy, sys, json, typing

Structure:
- induceC45.py - Fits C4.5 decision tree to training data
- classify.py - Predicts on test data using JSON decision tree, then compiles a
    performance report on the decision tree and returns the test data enriched
    with predictions.
- validation.py - Performs k-fold cross validation or leave-one-out cross
    validation on a training dataset. It then compiles a performance report on
    the process.

How to run
1. Setup
    a. Load the files into your environment of choice. Make sure that all python
        scripts are together in the same folder!!!! That way the dependent
        scripts can import and run functions from other scripts.
2. How to run induceC45.py
    a. In the command line, navigate to the directory where the scripts are.
    b. In the command line, use the following syntax:
       $ python3 induceC45.py <TrainingSetFile.csv> <threshold> [<restrictionsFile>] [--gratio] [--nooutput] [--noprint]
        - <TrainingSetFile.csv> is the training data file path
        - <threshold> should be a float representing the C4.5 threshold
        - [<restrictionsFile>] is an optional file path containing a
            newline-delimited vector of 1s and 0s, where 1 means that the
            corresponding column in that position in the training data should be
            included, and 0 means that it should not.
        - [--gratio] is an option that when included at the end means that the
            C4.5 algorithm should use the information gain ratio instead of
            information gain
        - [--nooutput] is an option that when included at the end means that
            no decision tree JSON file will be output. Omitting this means that
            a JSON file will be output.
        - [--noprint] is an option that when included at the end means that no
            decision tree will be printed to the console. Omitting this means
            that a decision tree will be printed to the console.
    c. If the [--nooutput] option has not been included, then the JSON decision
        tree should appear in your directory. You may now use it in classify.py.
3. How to run classify.py
    a. In the command line, navigate to the directory where the scripts are.
    b. In the command line, use the following syntax:
       $ python3 classify.py <CSVFile.csv> <JSONFile.json> [--test] [--nooutput] [--noprint]
        - <CSVFile.csv> is the data file path
        - <JSONFile.json> is the JSON decision tree file path
        - [--test] means that the data is a test dataset that has no class
            attribute.
        - [--nooutput] is an option that when included at the end means that
            no enriched CSV dataset or report will be output. Omitting this
            means that the CSV dataset enriched with predictions and a TXT
            performance report will be output.
        - [--noprint] is an option that when included at the end means that no
            report will be printed to the console. Omitting this means
            that a performance report will be printed to the console.
    c. If the [--nooutput] option has not been included, then the CSV dataset
            enriched with predictions and a TXT performance report should appear
            in your directory.
       The TXT performance report for training datasets will include:
        - The name of the data file
        - The name of the JSON decision tree file
        - The name of the class attribute
        - A confusion matrix
        - The total records classified, as well as the number of records
            correctly and incorrectly classified
        - The overall accuracy and error rate
      The TXT performance report for test datasets will include:
        - The name of the data file
        - The name of the JSON decision tree file
        - Frequency of each class label
        - The total records classified
4. How to run validation.py
    a. First ensure that both induceC45.py and classify.py are in the same
        directory, since validation.py imports functionality from both these
        scripts.
    b. In the command line, navigate to the directory where the scripts are.
    c. In the command line, use the following syntax:
       $ python3 validation.py <TrainingSetFile.csv> <threshold> <nfolds> [<restrictionsFile>] [--gratio] [--nooutput] [--noprint]
        - <TrainingSetFile.csv> is the training data file path
        - <threshold> should be a float representing the C4.5 threshold
        - <nfolds> should be an integer representing the number of folds desired
            in the k-fold cross validation. 0 means no cross-validation, and
            -1 means to use leave-one-out validation.
        - [<restrictionsFile>] is an optional file path containing a
            newline-delimited vector of 1s and 0s, where 1 means that the
            corresponding column in that position in the training data should be
            included, and 0 means that it should not.
        - [--gratio] is an option that when included at the end means that the
            C4.5 algorithm should use the information gain ratio instead of
            information gain
        - [--nooutput] is an option that when included at the end means that
            no TXT report file will be output. Omitting this means that
            a TXT performance report will be output.
        - [--noprint] is an option that when included at the end means that no
            performance report will be printed to the console. Omitting this
            means that a performance report will be printed to the console.
       The TXT performance report for validation.py will include:
        - The name of the data file
        - The name of the class attribute
        - The type of validation performed
        - A confusion matrix
        - The total records classified, as well as the number of records
            correctly and incorrectly classified
        - The overall accuracy, average accuracy and overall error rate
        - The overall precision, recall, PF and F measure
