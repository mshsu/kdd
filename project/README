    rules mining
- kmeans.py - Contains functions to perform KMeans algorithm for clustering
- dbscan.py - Contains functions to perform DBSCAN algorithm for clustering
- knn.py - Contains functions to perform KNN algorithm for classification
- induceC45.py - Contains functions to construct Decision Tree using C4.5
    algorithm for classification
- classify.py - Contains functions to classify using Decision Tree
- validation.py - Contains functions to perform model validation using C4.5
    algorithm
- randomforest.py - Contains functions to perform Random Forest ensemble method
    for classification
- Question1.ipynb - Codebook for Question 1
- Question2.ipynb - Codebook for Question 2
- Question3.ipynb - Codebook for Question 3

How to run
1. Setup
    a. Load the files into your environment of choice. Make sure that all python
        scripts and notebooks are together in the same folder!!!! That way the
        dependent scripts and notebookscan import and run functions from other
        scripts.
    b. Ensure that you have all the necessary packages.
2. How to run Jupyter notebooks (Question1.ipynb, Question2.ipynb,
    Question3.ipynb)
    a. Open the Jupyter notebook into your IDE of choice. You may run the
        notebooks in any order you wish.
    b. Press "Run All" or any equivalent to run all code chunks.
    c. WARNING: Code will take a long time to run.

# EXPECTED ERRORS
- You MUST have all scripts in the SAME LOCATION or there will be errors.
- Please be patient when running the scripts. They may be run in any order,
    but the code chunks within the notebooks must be run in order.
