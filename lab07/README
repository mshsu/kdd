# SUBMISSION DESCRIPTION
Python Scripts

# RUN INSTRUCTIONS
Must have the following packages:
- pandas, numpy, sys, time, typing

Structure:
- pageRank.py - Implements PageRank algorithm and produces printed report

How to run
1. Setup
    a. Load the files into your environment of choice. Make sure that all python
        scripts are together in the same folder!!!! That way the dependent
        scripts can import and run functions from other scripts.
2. How to run pageRank.py
    a. In the command line, navigate to the directory where the scripts are.
    b. In the command line, use the following syntax:
       $ python3 pageRank.py <nodeFile.csv> <d> [--dir]
        - <nodeFile> is the appropriately formatted graph representation file
            of edges as node pairs and their values
        - <d> is the d parameter in PageRank, representing the probability
            of traversing an edge (versus 1-d being the probability of
            spontaneously jumping to another node). Must be between 0 and 1,
            inclusive
        - --dir is an optional parameter to indicate if the nodeFile represents
            a directed graph. By default, an undirected graph is assumed.
    c. The following expected output should be printed to the terminal:
        - The value of d
        - The graph node/edge pair filename
        - The data read and PageRank processing time
        - The number of iterations for PageRank to converge
        - The ranking, name and PageRank score of all nodes in the graph

# PROGRAMS/FILES
Python scripts:
- pageRank.py
Output files:
- dolphins_results_0.25.txt, dolphins_results_0.5.txt,
    dolphins_results_0.75.txt, dolphins_results_1.txt - PageRank results for
    d = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 for dolphinsDir.csv
- lesmis_results_0.25.txt, lesmis_results_0.5.txt, lesmis_results_0.75.txt,
    lesmis_results_1.txt - PageRank results for d = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 for
    lesmisDir.csv
- NCAA_football_results_0.25.txt, NCAA_football_results_0.5.txt,
    NCAA_football_results_0.75.txt, NCAA_football_results_1.txt - PageRank
    results for d = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 for NCAA_football.csv

# EXPECTED ERRORS:
- The python scripts MUST ALL BE IN THE SAME FOLDER, or there will be errors.
- Please enter appropriate datatypes and filetypes in the terminal, or there
    will be errors.
- Please ensure all filetypes are appropriately formatted.
